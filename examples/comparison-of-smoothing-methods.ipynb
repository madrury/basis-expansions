    "\n",
    "To capture non-linearities in regression models, we need to transform some or all of the predictors.  To avoid having to treat every predictor as a special case needing investigation, we would like some way of applying a very general *family* of transformations to our predictors, which is flexible enough to adapt (when the model is fit) to a wide variety of shapes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This takes the general form of a *basis expansion*.  Basis here is used in the linear algebraic sense: a linearly independent set of objects.  In this case our objects are *functions*:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ B = f_1, f_2, \\ldots, f_k $$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The most commonly, and often *only*, example taught in introductory modeling courses or textbooks is **polynomial regression**.\n",

    "In polynomial regression we choose as our basis a set of polynomial terms of increasing degree:\n",

    "$$ f_1(x) = x, \\ f_2(x) = x^2, \\ \\ldots, \\ f_r(x) = x^r $$\n",

    "\n",
    "![Polynomials of Various Degrees](img/polynomial-various-degrees.png)\n",

    "Unfortunately, polynomial regression has a fair number of issues.  The most often observed is a very high varaince (sensitivity to data), especially near the boundaries of the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Polynomial Regressions on One Plot](img/polynomial-regressions-one-plot.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Above we have a fixed data set, and we have fit and plotted polynomial regressions of various degrees.  The most striking feature is how badly the higher degree polynomials fit the data near the edges.  The variance explodes!  This is especially problamatic in high dimensional situations where almost *all* of the data is near the boundaries, due to the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to look at this is to plot residuals for each data point $x$ over many samples from the same population, as we vary the degree of the polynomial we fit to the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Residuals from Polynomial Regression](img/polynomial-residuals-various-degrees.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we see the same pattern from earlier, the instability in our fits starts at the edges of the data, and moves inward as we increase the degree.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are other issues with polynomial regression; for example, it is inherently non-local, changing the value of $y$ at one point in the training set can affect the fit of the polynomial at data points very far away, resulting in tight coupling across the space of our data (often referred to as *rigidity*).  You can get a feel for this by playing around with the interactive [scatterplot somoothers](http://madrury.github.io/smoothers/) app hoseted on this site.\n",

    "### Binning Expansion\n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the first thing that occurs to most modelers when reflecting on other ways to capture non-linear effects in regression is to **bin** the predictor varaible:\n",

    "![Regression with Bins, Various Number of Cuts](img/bins-various-n-cuts.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In binned regression we simply cut the range of the predictor varaible into equally sized intervals (though we could use a more sophisticated rule, like cutting into intervals at percentiles of the marginal distribution of the predictor).  Membership in any interval is used to create a set of indicator variables, which are then regressed upon.  In the one predictor case, this results in our regression predicting the mean value of $y$ in each bin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binning has its obvious [conceptual issues](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/68834/what-is-the-benefit-of-breaking-up-a-continuous-predictor-variable).  Most prominently, we expect most phenomina we study to vary continuously with inputs.  Binned regression does not create continuous functions of the predictor, so in most cases we would expect there to be some unavoidable bias within each bin.  In the simple case where the true relationship is monotonic in an interval, we expect to be underpredicting the truth on the left hand side of each bin, and on the right hand side we are expect to overpredict.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Binned Regression vs. True Signal](img/binned-regression-vs-truth.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Even so, binning is popular.  It is easy to discover, implement, and explain, and often does a good enough job of capturing the non-linear behaviour of the predictor response relationship.  There are better options though, we will see later that other methods are both more cenceptually appealing, and do a better job of capturing the predictive power in the data with less estiamted parameters."

    "## Conclusions\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post we have compared four different approches to capturing general non-linear behaviour in regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binning\n",
    "\n",
    "Binning, which conceptualy simple, was seen to suffer from a few issues in comparison to the other methods\n",
    "\n",
    "  - With a small number of estiamted parameters, the binned regression suffered from a higher bias than its competitors.  It was seen across multiple experiments to achive its minimal hold out error at a larger number of estiamted parameters than the other methods, and furthermore, often the minimal error achieved by the binning method was *larger* than the minimum achieved by the other methods.\n",
    "  - The binned regression's hold out error often had a higher varaince than the other method's.  This means that, even if it performed just as well as another method *on average*, any *individual* binned regression is less trustrowthy than if using another method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Additionally, the binned regression method has the disadvantage of producing *discontinuous* functions, while we expect most processes we encounter in nature or business to vary continuously in thier inputs.  This is philosophically unnapealling, and also accounts for some of the bias seen when comparing the binning regressions to the other basis expansions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Polynomial Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "The major problem with polynomial regression is its instability once a moderate number of estimated parameters is reached.  Polynomial regressions as *highly* sensitive to the noise in our data, and in every example were seen to eventuall overfit violently; this feature was not seen in any of the other methods we surveyed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The polynomial regression also does not accumulate varaince uniformly throughout the support of the data.  We saw that polynomial fits become highly unstable near the boundaries of the available data.  This can be a sweious issue in higher dimensional situations (though we did not explore this), where the curse of dimensionality tells us that the *majority* of our data will lie close to the boundary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linear and Cubic Splines\n",
    "\n",
    "These methods performed well across the range of our experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - They overfit slowly, especially compared to polynomial regression.\n",
    "  - They generally achive a lower hold out error than the binned regressions, and achive thier minimum hold out error at a lower number of estimated parameters.\n",
    "  - Their hold out error is generally the lowest out of the methods we surveyed, making each *individual* regression more trustworthy.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The two spline models are a clear winner over the binned and polynomial regressions.  This is a real shame, because they are often not taught in introductory courses in predictive modeling, even though they (at least the piecewise linear spline) are just as easy to implement as polynomial or binned regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "We hope we have convinced you to use these methods in your own modeling work. The author sees no real reason to fit polynomial or binned expansions in any predictive or inferential model."
